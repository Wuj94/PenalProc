The collaborator who was asked to provide evidence or references for the reason why the accused person is meant to undergo a mental health check stated, the reason mentioned on paper - family notice - is not the real reason.
Reasons behind the notification of mental check are related to people in Santeramo in Colle, Bari and to the military airport in Gioia del Colle, Bari.

After scheduling an appointment for the 4th of December 2024 at 0930 and having a quick conversation with a different nurse, the psychiatrist does not 
seem to be happy to consider his future patient's concerns. This is, the accused person. The psychiatrist's from Gioia del Colle, Bari opinion is to inject a lower dose of the same antipsycothic.
