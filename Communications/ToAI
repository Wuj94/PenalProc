Hi, my name is Giuseppe Calabrese.
After being persecuted by different mafia organisations starting from the South of Italy (the so called, 'Albanian mafia') throughout Europe, they've also filed me and provoked a penal process in Italy. I'm resident in London.
The worst happened in Rome and Milan, where people I've never met in my life were constantly checking about my behaviour. They say 'checking my behaviour', It feels like 'persecuting me'. As soon as I wreck someone, they send me to court. I learnt, that's not a solution in this Italy made of fascists who appeal to mafia to prove their strength.
They tried to kill me in 2017 in Bari, in a car accident causing a DAI. An Albanian mafia guy called Gerald Guza punched me soon after making my DAI worse, in Santeramo in Colle (BA). 
In Rome, students of La Sapienza had fun doing the same thing, it was 2018. This group of people, after committing the GBH, lied in front of the Police and brought me to court where I had to pay.
Next, people from Polytechnic university of Milan ruined my reputation while I was in London making my 20's an horror movie. They broke my knee at Stansted airport. 
Basically, after persecuting me, as soon as they get a punch, it becomes an handicap match of WWE. 10 against 1.
I'm not scared of making it public but I'd like to understand if this behaviour is a standard behaviour or it is for people from the South only who mafia are not.
My father is retired, he was in Police Special Forces. I joined MBDA in Rome and I've been in contact with classified information. Moreover, I was shown to the major head of State. I'm not sure what was the meaning of it, but I have to give reasons for me not willing to join mafia. (wasn't it illegal?!)
I know I'm better than this people, I know I'm stronger but know I want to understand what's the perspective of the law.
Could you please help me checking Rome and Milan? I think they don't deserve power and wealth they have.
