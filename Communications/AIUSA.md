Dear Sir or Madam,

# Introduction
My name is Giuseppe Calabrese, from Gioia del Colle, Bari. Temporarily located at my parents' house in 
Santeramo in Colle, Bari.
I was born in Santeramo in Colle on the 2nd of October 1994, from a family from Bari and Potenza, in 
Italy. I achieved my High School Diploma in Gioia del Colle in 2014 at Technical School for the Industry 
- G. Galilei.
I achieved my bachelor's degree at University of Bari in Computer Science in early 2018.
I moved to Rome at the age of 23 in 2018 and to London at the age of 24 in 2019. 
I subscribed to AIRE, Italian Association for Foreign Residents. So, from the legal point of view, I live 
in London.
For the sake of this penal process, I temporarily moved back to my parents' house, in Santeramo in Colle.
I have good reason from the legal point of view to call myself Gioiese, that means I am from Gioia del 
Colle. This expression drifts away from the actual meaning. It should be taken as "I am OF Gioia del 
Colle", meaning I usually share resources with them.
There is a military airport in Gioia del Colle and I have been in contact with classified information of 
the Italian State. Those information were classified as RESERVED and CONFIDENTIAL at Gioia del Colle 
Airport 36o Stormo (Ref: Domenico Daleno (Valenzano, Bari), Arturo Levato (Gioia del Colle)) and in Rome 
at MBDA (Ref: Franco Felici (Rome)).
I was also presented to the Major Head of the Italian State during my internship at MBDA. 
From the University perspective, the professor managing this internship was Antonio Cianfrani (Rome).
Morevoer, my old Italian phone number is a Police or Army phone number my father gave to me. 
It should be traced as well (+39 331 374 2502).
I am not Catholic. I am not Cristian. I have an Italian Passport, a secular (laic) anti-fascist State.
I think, it clearly would make no sense for me to lie to Amnesty International at this stage.

My ancestors were all involved in the World conflicts. 
One of them was taken as a prisoner from the British/US army (my great grandfather Martino Calabrese, 
from Bari). Nothing wrong happened, they gave him food and they sent him back home.
My grandfather, Nonno Frank (Francesco Calabrese, born in Cassano delle Murge, Bari died in Santeramo in 
Colle, Bari) was fighting on the square, to force them to stop. I also know what happened.
My father Martino Calabrese (Bari, Modugno, Santeramo in Colle) is a retired State police officer, he had to stem the Kosovo flooding in Santeramo during the 90's and 00's. 
He joined the State Police (Special Forces, Road Police in Milan, Spinazzola, Gioia del Colle, Matera) when he was a Karate athlete.
Currently, he is under mandatory health treatment for psychiatric reasons. 
It is the Italian State itself that makes this treatment start. I think sometimes he speaks against his will but, by the Italian law, 
what a person with psychiatric disorders says is not really accounted for.
My brother and my sister are teachers for the State school. My entire family works for the Italian State, 
I think there must be something absurd. I would ask them if it is us who do not pay taxes.

There is an undergoing penal process on the behalf of the court of Bari.
The problem is, Northern Italians sold the South of Italy. Without any consent from the Southern Italians.
They probably had an agreement with Rome. But in Italy we have regions and provinces, they had no rights.
Most likely, by the Albanian mafia, who are backed by Romanian people (Ref: Bogdan Brindusan, who calls 
himself Romanian, living in London, previously in the US, working for Auctane) and Eastern Europe mafia 
organizations.
Behind them, we can expect Russians people to manage this all. I can give you a pointer, Polina Balashova 
(Kaluga, Moscow, Russia). 
I met her at EF School, Roupell Street, London in July, 2018. To investigate further on her, you could 
ask Sara Massaro (Naples, Milan), a solicitor from the forum of Milan. 
The cause of all of this is something that in the US and in Bari was already known. It is the so called 
Albanian mafia, coming from Kosovo.

I am accused and there are three charges to face in total.
The first one is solved but there are other twos that are yet to be processed.
I had to work for the Italian Red Cross in Gioia del Colle for 5 or 6 months.
Documents are attached “PresenzePubblicaUtilitaBuonaSaluteGiuseppeCalabrese.zip”.

All of this led to human rights violation. I am sending this email to the US because most of the people 
involved have a strong relationship with the Albanian mafia, which is held by people from Kosovo.
Well, if I am writing to you, clearly I am not involved in any mafia association. I do not share 
resources with them. Of *any kind*.
During my journey in the software industry to London where my residence currently is, I have been 
conspired and persecuted by the Albanian mafia.
Most of them are from Kosovo. We all know what their culture is, and we do not like it.
Everything started in the very epicentre of these criminal associations, namely Santeramo in Colle (BA).
The Kosovo war is over. But, these people are still here doing mafia. I need help. 
A third party who is ready to double check on Rome and Milan. The biological consequences of the last war are really important.
Unfortunately, people from Bari easily understand people from Rome or Milan. It does not happen the other way around. 
As a quick example, people from Bari easily learn Italian from Rome (it is a language per-se). 
It is hardest for people from Rome to learn Bari language (we informally call them ‘dialects’, but these are languages).
I put Mr. Elliot Moulster and Mrs. Letizia Serini in CCs.
Elliot is my duty solicitor I had the pleasure of meeting him after being in remand at HMP Chelmsford. +44 7939 223575
Letizia was assigned to me at Malpensa Airport, in Milan. She is now my solicitor from the forum of Bari. +39 373 761 0130

They opened up a new mafia business, I named it `body laundry`.
It is similar to money laundry, in this case they are washing members of mafia associations. 
Mostly, for the software industry.
They commit crimes and work for mafia for years, then they make themselves known in another city.
Once they move out to northern Italy or abroad, they refer themselves `from the second city`.
People in the second city do not really know about their true identity and reply with a clean 
sponsorship. We could call this process, self-conspiracy. 
Basically, I could conspire myself to make people think I am someone who I am not.

To make members of these organization move out, they have been pulling back normal people from abroad 
without them knowing, using the Italian law. I am one of these.
To do so, members of these organizations file people at 'Caserma dei Carabinieri' (similar to the Police 
Station) even if they have no right to use the Italian Jurisdiciton and most of the times, there is no 
proof of what is alleged.
Mafia is an alternative service to Court, and it is illegal.

A typical example is - member of the organization conspire and persecute a subject until he looses 
control.
We all know what are the effects of conspiracy on people's mind. 
They make people go crazy and, as soon as they loose control, these people are filed. This is already a trauma, the cause and the consequence depend on the same people.
These organizations are not local organizations, they span the entire European continent. Up to the UK.
Many of them have been living in London, UK in the past.
And they don't even have a valid passport.

Monkeys will be better than many humans in a short while.

# Initial Context
About my case, everything started in Gioia del Colle, province of Bari. 
I was part of a huge group of friends, some of them were part of my musical group, others were my school 
friends, some others were just friends of friends who joined. 
There were about 5 or 6 people initially. It all started from my boy band and my friends from school.
We ended up in about 20 people from three or four different towns of the South of Italy.
Gioia del Colle (BA), Santeramo in Colle (BA), Cassano delle Murge (BA) and Acquaviva delle Fonti (BA).
At some point, the Albanian mafia sneaked inside this social arrangement when we decided to split
the group of friends by town.
We were 25 years old in average, at this time.
In 2017, I was involved in a car accident in Cassano delle Murge, the dynamic of the accident is not 
clear at all and it could be an attempted murder.
The net result was a DAI (diffuse axonal injury) and a chest trauma. There is a medical statement and 
various diagnoses to prove what I'm saying. It was January 2018.

# Gioia - 2016
Claudio Mastronardo (Santeramo in Colle, Bologna, Milano) started persecuting me when we were 10 years old.
His father is half Italian, half German. Claudio started because that was the teaching of his father and his mother
influenced by people from Germany he was visiting during the summer.
When we were kids, we used to share a group of friends, as part of this group there was Gianluca Difonzo (Santeramo in Colle), 
the son of the clerk at the Court of Bari.
At some point we split, his conspiracy behaviour was making me violent against him. I beat him up many times and they excluded me.
Of course, for the Catholic-Mafia culture of Santeramo in Colle, the consequence (my assault) was the problem. Not the cause (his conspiracy).
We were attending the same school in Gioia del Colle (BA) but he wasn't hanging out in Gioia del Colle in the afternoon or in the evening.
He is from Santeramo in Colle. I became from Gioia del Colle to get rid of their conspiracy. 
This was an arrangement by the Italian State, my father was a police officer like Giacinto Mancino's (Gioia del Colle) father was.
I realised it when I grew up.
Proof are attached - inside Fascicolo.zip - the folder `Fascicolo/diffamazione` contains screenshots of the Facebook groups we used to use to arrange meetings.
Claudio is never there. Elisa Pennelli appears just once.

Claudio Mastronardo during the 5th year of high school in Gioia del Colle, convinced my classmates to 
join mafia.
Because, "that's how it works here". An old saying that means, either you join or you will be out of the loop. 
They were doing it behind my back, they had to try their mafia techniques on me. 
I started feeling anxious and depressed, I couldn't understand the reason.
I went to the hospital asking for help, they told me it was due to a stomach inflammation after a gastroscopy.
It actually is a consequence of stress but that was not the root cause. It was conspiracy.
I had to withdraw from school for health reasons and try again the next year, when I finally succeeded 
taking my high school diploma under the supervision of Domenico Daleno and Arturo Levato.

He had done it even before with the group of friends we were sharing when we were kids. 
He lives 2 minutes from my house.

Mafia is a bad habit, if people do not improve their life-style, they won't change their bad habits. 
But, the law system makes it hard for people who are convicted to improve their life-style.

# Santeramo - Bari - 2017
These 3 people are - Nicola Digirolamo (Santeramo in Colle), Claudio Mastronardo (Santeramo in Colle, 
Bologna) and Elisa Pennelli (Santeramo in Colle, Milano, Vienna) suddenly joined my group of friends.
The latter is the ex girlfriend of Gerald Guza (Kosovo, Santeramo in Colle, Padova). 
Gerald Guza was and probably still is at the top of the hierarchy of the Albanian mafia, taking over 
his father. All of these people mentioned are from Santeramo in Colle (BA). Some of them moved out to find a 
job in Milan or even abroad. But they often come back to check the result of their mafia business. 
Or to arrange new scams to the Italian State.

I’ll give you a couple of examples to better explain myself.
How do they get to move out? They use body laundry. 
After laundry, Elisa Pennelli is now from Milan and she is a really nice person from there. 
This person is tied with the worst mafia boss in the country.
Claudio Mastronardo says he is from Gioia del Colle, where the military airport is. 
Would you consider someone from Gioia del Colle a bad person? 
Of course not, nobody would. 
This person used to conspire me since I was a kid. We used to share a group of friends and his mafia role was "cud ca t lass da sul" (the one who leaves you alone). This is what I've heard.
I couldn't understand until now why I was left alone after him being around.

I suddenly broke up with the Santeramo wing of this group of people, after a stunt made by Romilda DiSerio (Santeramo in Colle) and Nico Digirolamo. 
Nico Digirolamo was sexually harassing Romilda DiSerio and I thought an harassment it was not. 
Involved in all of this was Mariateresa D'Ippolito (Santeramo in Colle, Alessandria, Dortmund). 
She was probably arranging this split with Nico Digirolamo and Claudio Mastronardo.
I had a chat with Nico Digirolamo and I told him I had no romantic interest in Romilda DiSerio. 
It was ok for me for him to try with her. She was my friend. 
And I trusted Claudio Mastronardo saying Nicola Digirolamo changed, he was a good person at that time. 
Unfortunately, Romilda DiSerio couldn't understand and she kept sexually provoking me in presence of 
other friends of *mine*. Mine, because all started from my classmates and my boy band.
She only was the girlfriend of the guitarist, Nicola Lassandro (Santeramo in Colle, Bari).
That was not ok, I gave her the trauma back using a bad word. 
I can justify her behaviour now that I am older, she is retarded. But she never told me, the rumor came 
to my hear from Nicola Lassandro. Then, he said it again while Romilda DiSerio was listening and she did 
not complain, she nodded with a sad face. I assume that was a confirmation.
The reason why Nicola Digirolamo joined the group was Claudio Mastronardo, who lives 2 minutes from my 
house. 
Nicola Digirolamo and Claudio Mastronardo had to take a mafia revenge for one of his friend about the eviction 
given to him after my uncle's lawyer and the decision of the Court of Bari. 
I was not involved in the eviction, but he is my uncle and somebody from my family had to pay. 
This is what mafia does. And I’m not part of it.
Elisa Pennelli was left alone because she had a problem with most of her classmates at school. 
She joined the group of friends because of Romilda DiSerio saying her classmates were all wrong. 
She probably was involved in criminal organizations since then. And her classmates caught her.
Her tie to the Albanian Mafia was Gerald Guza (Santeramo in Colle, Padova), who was her boyfriend.
And, if you are part of the so called Albanian mafia (that is from Kosovo), you never loose. 
At least, this is what they make people believe, other than `we stay all together`, before taking resources that do not belong to them.
So, she had the possibility to move to Milan to pursue her Bachelor's degree at Polytechnic University of Milan. Instead of facing the law.
Now Milan is as dirty as Bari was before the Kosovo war. But it is still latent. They will come out in a while.
The American Army won the war in Kosovo with people from the South of Italy, but these people are hard to be taught.
We need to reduce their scope and span before it is too late.

I tried not to care much about it, I found new friends straight after to play music with and I had planned to move to Rome for my MSc. 
I had introduced myself to Michelangelo Musci (Santeramo in Colle, Roma) before and he came close with Mattia Petronella (Santeramo in Colle, Bari).
I thought in the capital there would have been no space for such people.

# Rome - 2018
Once moved to Rome, I got along with many people, they were from different parts of Italy. 
I had a nice group of friends - Riccardo Cervelli (Rome), Michele Cernigliaro (Udine), a Brazilian 
guy, a Polish girl, a Serbian woman and some others. We were drinking and listening to music in 
Trastevere, collaborating for the assignments and playing jokes to each others.
Suddenly, they stopped relating to me and they started conspiring me. 
The Albanian mafia reached out to them, as soon as I gave to one of the attendant of the MSc in Data 
Science a record from MadSpit. This is the music group I was playing for in the South of Italy after I 
broke up with the huge group of friends.
Members were I, Filippo Losito (Gioia del Colle), Sergio Sako (known on the UK register as Sergei Sako or 
Sergei Pupi, he used to attend primary school in Kensington, London; London, Santeramo in Colle, Monza, 
Milan), Filippo Zullo (Santeramo in Colle), Michelangelo Musci (Santeramo in Colle).
People involved in this persecution, slander and defamation were Riccardo Cervelli (Roma), Lorenzo Giusti 
(Roma), Ilaria Servadio (Roma), Giulia Maravalli (Roma, Bruxelles), Davide Manfredini (Frascati, Roma, 
Grottaferrata), Michele Cernigliaro (Udine) and many others.
I think a Greek colleague taught them to conspire and they did it all together, they had to try the fun.
There was a Serbian woman on my side trying to push them back, I still remember.
I couldn't understand at that time what was happening on my brain, I couldn't stand still and It was 
hardest for me to relate to my university colleague. Even to get close to them. That was how conspiracy 
feels, now I do know.
A student from another department named Sergio Sica, punched me at my right eye and making it red and 
swollen while I was sitting eating some bread, in the study room (Aula 2 - Room 2), at Sapienza 
University of Rome, Via Eudossiana, ground floor.
It seems, for fascist people, eating two slices of bread one on top of the other when you couldn't find a 
'panino' (a smaller bread) available at the bakery, is a good reason to hurt. 
After punching, I spontaneously walked back and forth in the room. I could not understand 
much but after about 10 minutes, I was really angry and I wanted to fight back. There were about 10 
people on his side. They called the police and after congregating they slandered me the heaviest.
They never paid. Because of the law, they never do. 
I don't know if the Pope gave them a benediction, this is the usual process. They commit a crime,
they arrange a gathering at University, the Pope throws some water around, and the worst criminal in this 
world are ready to go. Ridiculous, aren't they?
Mafia and the Catholic Church are strict relatives.
I was young and I thought having a revenge to stop their continuous humiliation could have worked.
I waited outside the study room few days after for one of them to come out. I had to punch back but the 
one who came out was one of the most quiet I met in there. So, I faked an assault pushing him in the 
toilet and head locking him.
He started screaming, 3 other people came in toilet. 
One of them is Gianvito Neri (not sure about his forename) and his father is from Monopoli, Bari stepped 
inside and punched me on my face. Nobody invited him. They were four against one. 
He can be my sis if he doesn't want to pay.
Do you remember when you bombed Rome too many times during the WWII? I think that's where it all come 
from. You gave them the trauma, It now propagates from father to son. 
It should not be always be people from Bari taking their trauma back.

During this hard time, I spent all of my money trying to find relief in the material world. I could not 
find a good friend and it seems some of my colleagues at university were instructed by some of the 
professors to make me submit. I was `too much from the South`. 
I realized it when a colleague from Naples put his arm around my shoulder. That was a big no for a 
Southern Italian guy like me.
The only two people staying close to me were Polina Balashova and Gianpaolo.
Polina is a very clever Russian woman I met in London the year before. She was learning English with me 
and we were playing all sorts of jokes with the aim of improving our speaking skills. She asked me to 
help her with Italian language she wanted to learn, but I never really accepted it. Learning English was 
a good point for both of us. All in all, she was my pen-friend and there was something about us.
Gianpaolo was my roommate, a student of engineering at Sapienza. We used to share tricks about assignments
and buy kebab on Friday. That is a `complete meal`, he taught me after taking classes for diabetes.

Before the end of the summer, Polina suddenly broke up with me. We weren't in a relationship, but we had 
plans. We wanted to meet in Paris and we had to choose London or Rome. I was fairly sure London was a 
better place for us because the weather of Rome is too hot, for the tone of her skin.
Before closing the door, she gave me a very important advice. Depression is not an illness.
I was taking meds for this disorder. I stopped and she was right. It depends on your lifestyle (and on 
people conspiring you).
This became suspicious because I had no idea my internship at MBDA could have been in contrast, given the 
military positions of these two countries. The supervisor at MBDA, Marco DiFerrante (Rome) soon before 
asked me who I was constantly texting. I think he reached out to the university-side supervisor at 
Sapienza, and they did all of the rest.

Later on I realized I was in the wrong place since the beginning. I'm from the South, in 2019 
they were probably removing the South from the map. 
People from Apulia became 'the Albanians' at some point.

I'm also suspicious they put an EEG device in my right ear. I also guess this can't be removed since it 
becomes part of the ear tissues. It must be similar to one of those the US Army was building during the 
Cold War.

# Gioia - 2019
Going back to the South from Rome in the summer, I was meeting my ex bandmates, Madspit. Few times I 
managed to arrange meetings in Gioia del Colle and friends were not there anymore. The only ones were 
Rosaria Mola (Gioia del Colle) and Filippo Losito who was part of the band. Sergio Sako was withdrawing 
every time. I started being suspicious after Filippo started singing an old song of an Italian singer 
called Pupo, and someone mentioned Pupi mafia family from Santeramo in Colle, Bari. In another occasion, 
I agreed with Sergio Sako, his father was a counterexample.
This mafia family from Kosovo used to live in London, UK until the end of the 90s or beginning of 00s.
It probably was Claudio Mastronardo telling them not to come close to me, with the help of Nicola 
Digirolamo (Santeramo in Colle), Mariateresa D'Ippolito, Rossella Iacobellis (Santeramo in Colle), 
Vincenzo Tortorelli (Santeramo in Colle, Bologna), Nicola Lassandro (Santeramo in Colle, Bari), Rocco 
Putignano (Santeramo in Colle), Gianfranco Giove (Santeramo in Colle), Michele Plantamura (Santeramo in 
Colle, Taranto) e Vito Stasi (Santeramo in Colle).
Gianluca Pavone (Gioia del Colle) and Giacinto Mancino (Gioia del Colle) might know more.

# MBDA - 2019
Going back to Rome in September, there was a bittersweet news. They wanted to hire me permanently, but 
the salary had to be lower.
The reason was, I had not achieved my MSc yet at Sapienza.
A friend from Gioia del Colle took me out of it, Giuseppe LaSelva (Gioia del Colle) asked me to move to London.

# London - 2019
Moved to London I started working for Shake-Shack in Covent Garden first and later for Costa Coffee, 
after Gianpierangelo Depalma (Gioia del Colle, London - Costa Coffee) gave me a reference. 
It was not easy even there. The Italians started talking behind my backs even if Gianpierangelo was 
initially pushing them back. He gave up after a while.
I had to pay my bills and working at the cafe was fair. 
Bedri, the store manager, was not sure about what other colleagues were saying about me and he decided to 
move me to other branches. To avoid any further problem.
Later on, I started working for different companies in IT.

While I was working for Metapack (ref: Bogdan Brindusan, London - Metapack, Auctane, Preply; Natalie 
Parker, London - Metapack, Auctane, Instant Group) during the lock-down for the COVID pandemic, I 
arranged with my flatmate Luigi Caputo (Afragola, Naples, London - Costa Coffee) a dinner to share. 
He invited a couple of young women with the intent of infecting me with Covid-19.
They succeeded, I could not stand anymore and Luigi was having fun laughing about me while I was lying on 
the sofa. I was training and an adrenaline shot in my brain made me go mad. We were drunk and I 
repeatedly beat him up. I had to attend court in 2022 and they found me guilty. I had to pay about 1200£ 
and I had to attend unpaid work for 150 hours on Saturday. It was not bad but a couple of days before the 
end of UPW, Diogo Lima (Braga, Rome), the line manager of SteelEye LTD (London, 55 The Strand), suddenly 
fired me without a meaningful reason. 
It was gross. It was clearly agreed with someone from Italy. I had to go to Milan and work as a slave of 
Rome.

Infecting people with Covid-19 is attempted murder I think. Nobody paid for it.
I also think the community of Albanians and Northern Italians were behind people who infected me.
Most of the Italian and Albanian women in London are conspiring people on behalf of the Albanian mafia.
I finally had to sell my motorbike and move out of London since I couldn't find a new job easily with a 
criminal record and a pending charge due to the fight. 
It takes sometime for the probation office to process the outcome of UPW.
As soon as I finished my UPW, I took a flight back to Bari. London is too expensive to live without work. 
I would have spent all of my savings in less than a year.

In June 2023, I went back to London from Bari to take back my belongings left in my room in Whitechapel 
area.
I felt conspiracy on my shoulder again. My brain wasn't allowing me to relax and stand still. They 
were all talking about me in the area.
Things got worse at Stansted airport, I lost control when Northen Italian women and a class of children 
for foreign language exchange were laughing off my face. I am not a Nobel Prize but I am good as a 
software engineer. 
In the corridor leading to the on-boarding fence, I felt in danger. Too many people for a person under 
conspiracy like me. 
I started running and, to escape from the crowd, I gave an elbow or maybe a push to an Italian woman.
I pushed a guy who was running behind me on the floor who tried to punch me. That was a miss.
I also was hit by the crowd, I was on the floor with a broken knee and a couple of bruises on my chest.
I will attach MRI scans at the end.
Taken to custody at the Police Station after hospital, I went to HMPrison Chelmsford waiting for court. 
I was on remand and I had the chance to meet a some good friends. In my wing, we were good. That's not 
the kind of environment I like, but some of us were just holding each other trying to find a way to have 
a laugh and not think about it. In prison you also find people with no criminal mind.

Currently, there is a suspended sentence in the UK on me. I think the overlapping of the Italian penal 
process and the UK suspended sentence is not fair.
The cause behind these procedures is shared. It is people from Kosovo who started shadowing me since I 
moved out of the South of Italy. 
A shadow is a mafia role. It is someone who constantly follows you. I think I had a couple in my life.
They can't accept the loss inflicted by my grandfather, who fought them successfully (I think he had an 
agreement with the army from Gioia del Colle to fight them on the square) and my father Martino Calabrese 
who is a retired police man who has spent 20 years of his life stemming them away from my family.

# My concerns
- I've asked for help to my electronic teachers. One of them told me I could try to go for a X-rays scan. 
Problem is, I fear the device is too small to be detected or seen after acquisition.
- I think in Rome they took a terrible decision to wreak the South. They made people from the South think 
we had to be a coach for a big train that goes like this: Berlin - Frankfurt - Milan - Rome - Bari - 
Tirana.
But basically the mafia culture of Bari is in contrast with the Nazi-Fascism of Berlin, Frankfurt, Milan 
& Rome. Plus, in Tirana they're not making it fair. 
They learnt mafia from the Italians, now they are mixing it with fascism. 
These two concepts can't meet without a catastrophe. They could not do the counting. 
This way, the South will be taken from Tirana (which includes Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Greece and 
Bulgaria. Even if people think it's just Albania and Kosovo) and all of the others will force the North (
London) to change to fascism. 
And it will not work again. 
In the end, a society based on conspiracy built by Berlin, Rome and Tirana is something humans do not 
like. And it is science saying.
- There are two ways out of this, from my point of view:
	1) They give me my life back. This is an hard rollback.
		It includes friends, music, fame, women, work, and more.
	2) I can ask for asylum but people involved have to pay for it. 
	A final notice, turning myself into a member of a mafia organization is not an option. I like science 
	and sports. Mafia is only for the weak. 
	Turning myself into a fascist is not an option either. That's just not my culture. I'm from the South.
- They are probably looking at what I'm writing. I have asked Apple support to check my laptop. This 
could have been turned into 'we share his screen' by Milan. Where Apple is.
It is an Apple MacBook Pro, I spent quite a lot of money for it and this is not what It was meant to be. 
I've been working on a personal project in the last year, using cutting edge technologies. 
These technologies were already in use in the US and in a few UK companies with connections to the US. 
I did it because I wanted to continue my journey. 
I'm from Gioia del Colle and the turn for us is Bari - London - Los Angeles. 
If they have been looking at me working, they have learnt the same thing with less-than-a-half of the 
effort or time.
The average salary for people able to work on a given tech-stack (set of technologies) reduces if there 
are many people able to do it (basic supply-demand). 
Every professional subject in the IT industry would suffer a decrease in its supply power. Keywords for 
technologies are: Scala, AWS, Typelevel, Spark, RDBMS, NoSQL, Redis, Functional Programming and others.
I have also noticed, all of the positions on this tech-stack in the UK and US have been taken in the last 
few months. Did it happen randomly?
What I've been doing is not basic, it took years of study and years of work in the industry.
I used Atlassian for the project. I paid the subscription until I could. Hopefully they can help.

# Human Rights Violation
There are many lists for human rights, sometimes human rights are not disclosed.
I know a couple they have broken for sure.

The right to determination
	Somebody decided for me I had not to deal with a Russian young woman, Polina.
	Somebody decided for me I had to work in Italy.
	Somebody decided for me a Covid-19 infection would have make me part of the group of 
		'already-infected' people. (Herd immunity, from the Italian expression)

The right to provenance
	I was born in Santeramo in Colle. The hospital was built by people from Bari, to avoid overcrowding.
		The community of Santeramo in Colle is something I don't belong to. For different reasons:
			- some of them has deliberately said "we all are mafia here". I've never been part of any 
				mafia organization.
			- In the all region, people from this town are the only ones who move to Germany. I have
				never been in Germany and I am not interested on learning more about their culture. 
	I say I am from Gioia del Colle for many reasons:
		- There is a military airport. There are people from the army. I have been in contact with classified information many times.
		- I had sex the first time in my life with a young woman from Gioia del Colle, I was 18 years old. It was the first time for her too. Her name is Noemi Curione, she was 17 years old.
	People are still saying I am from Santeramo in Colle. 
	This way, whatever I achieve in my life, mafia organizations will take their part. 
	Problem is, I do not share resources with them and I do not want to share in the future.
	Moreover, if people keep making illegal agreements (for example, human traffic) behind my back 
	because I travel around Europe, the Police thinks it is me the one who is managing all of this. 
	An old saying from Apulia - the one who splits is the one who takes the best split. After all.

Human Traffic
	The last agreement I have heard about looking on the internet and on social networks is about Albanian people moving to Milan and to London. 
	Where they were moving from? From Santeramo in Colle.
	Problem is, Albanians they are not (they do not have a passport, most likely they are from Kosovo) 
	and after this people have been conspiring me for years, when I go back to London I will find them 
	there. They are in the same area I have been living for 3 years, E1. 
	Claudio Mastronardo and Sergio Sako should be involved.
	Of course, the slogan I heard around was 'We help the Albanian Kids'.

Privacy Violation
	If they've been sharing my screen while I'm writing now or when I was building my personal project
	few months ago, that is privacy violation.

I apologies for writing this section, I am not a judge nor a lawyer but I wanted to give you the feeling 
of what It is like.

# My Resources
I am currently supported by the Italian and UK law system.
I do not have a security clearance but It should not be hard to fix this with the help of the military airport in Gioia del Colle and/or MBDA in Rome.

# Encore
1) What about `Le Iene` TV show? We've all seen the picture of one of the characters described in this 
letter in their TV Studio, Milan. 
In Milan they have not understood they should not deal with people from the South, if they are from the 
North (or the Centre). For biological reasons, the result of the last war wants people from the South to be smarter than 
people from the North. As a consequence, they are from the North and they would like to speak about the South 
without asking for the opinion of people who *live* here.
This body laundry is not a fair laundry.
Just turn the lights off for a minute. 

2) I have hired more than a solicitor in Italy to cope with this situation.
Most of them have not given me support. About one in particular, he is called Pierluigi Conti, from the 
forum of Rome. 
Pierluigi lives in Rome and as an interface to the South, he has a civil lawyer. 
His name is Giuseppe Natuzzi from the forum of Altamura (BA).
At some point during the process, Giuseppe gave me the bill. This bill was swinging, it changed a couple 
of times. Point is, during a penal process this is a contradiction. A bill can be 10 EUR or 20 EUR, not 
both. I dropped him and tried to reach out to Pierluigi. I met Pierluigi once and I thought he was a good 
man. I wanted Pierluigi to confirm the bill but he wasn't happy at all about my phone call.
So, I could not confirm. 
I decided to drop them both but I guess at Court, in Rome my reputation is compromised.
If you consider Rome is the capital of Italy, what's the impact from the international point of view?

3) There are people bothering my family. My dad comes home for lunch shocked sometimes. And he doesn't
want to tell why. On the same day, my mom comes back home from work and she says that she looks really nervous. 
She has lost a 20 EUR note. It flew away. Would you trust?

These are two address to check. They are just around my father's.
Via Mons. Giove, 63
Via Mons. Giove, 101/103

4) They called me at the Police Station recently in Santeramo. 
Members of a mafia gang gave them an alarm.
First thing first, the local police (aka, the penguins) knocks at the door. 
They've got something to say.

(voice-over)
It's been about 20 years they have an agreement with the Albanian mafia in Santeramo in Colle.
Nonetheless, they still knock at the door. He-he!

As soon as you step foot in the Police Station,
'We are going to give you a Mandatory Sanitary Treatment next time you come'.
I don't understand why but, at the moment I can't use the Police public service. 
If they come for a heist, I'll give Jesus Christ himself a prey. I can't do better than that.

5) They have taken my family. The Albanian mafia has taken my family.
My mom, my sister and my brother broke up with me.

6) I have asked for a passport check for all the people involved in this process. 
This is needed since some of the people involved I know are stateless.

I hope the content is clear enough. I am attaching proves of what is said in this email.
Please let me know once the download is done. I would like to block access to download given the confidentiality of the information.

I wish you a nice start of the week.

With kind regards,

It contains proof about the group of friends from Gioia del Colle, Santeramo in Colle, Cassano delle Murge and Acquaviva delle Fonti.
It contains a scan of a report for a visit about the good status of my mental health.
It also contains the spread sheet about the presence for UPW at the Red Cross in Gioia del Colle. 
This allowed my discharge from the first accusation.
It contains scans about my broken knee and reports given by specialised doctors.
Even if it is not written, Dr. Emilio Sion opposed himself to the report given by the radiologist.
He advised an urgent surgery because of the broken cross ligament.
It should be clear from the last scan anyway.
