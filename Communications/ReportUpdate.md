# Report Updates

Good evening,

Sorry for the time taken, It’s still me. Giuseppe Calabrese, born in Santeramo in Colle (BA) on the 02/10/1994, provenance South. I am American from the South. Passport attached.
I hope this email will find you well and hopefully this will not sound too insistent. I am from a military zone, Gioia del Colle (BA). In this setting, the military perspective of the process is to be considered.
It feels like, there hasn't been enough respect given for who won the last armed conflicts. The final results in Europe were given by the British, the American and last but not least, the army of Bari. 
It sounds like somebody is trying to invert a dependency that it is understood from a genetic test or inferred from the result of the last wars. 
Supremacy is not only about the pilot who drives the best in the airborne, less evolved people must not drive humanity.

## Part 1

1. During the penal process, Rome with the help of foreign people on the hills (Gioia del Colle area, Santeramo in Colle 
in particular) have stolen knowledge from the accused person. They carried on with this behavior 
throughout the years. Even during the penal process. Spy/Tracking Devices have been put in use 
One of these is the in-ear devices working by EM waves. This allows communication through brain 
waves. My privacy is broken, whatever I do is known and possibly shared to the public, since 
there is a penal process that allows them to break privacy. Privacy about personal information, 
not about what I see or think. Everything was done by an army I am not sure is part of my 
territory. 
Please break Rome-London or Milan-London bridges, those are two of the most disgusting social 
failures I have experienced in my life. I think, their genes and cultures did not change 
significantly from what they were less than a century ago. During the WWII. The same thing 
happens for the US. 
This is my very first explicit request in the military landscape, if I can.
People from Northern Italy are accused of invading the UK and US territory using rights of 
people from Bari. By using fake passports which are confirmed by Rome with no consent.
They must leave occupied territories as soon as possibile.
One of these in-ear devices is installed and currently working in the skull of the author of
this communication. Probably, in MBDA, Rome, 2019 during my university internship.   
Suspected are people from Rome, Santeramo in Colle, province of Bari, small city that was 
held by a well-known criminal organization from Rome. The so called 'Magliana band'.
Also cameras on glass lenses have been installed. Not only on my eye glasses for myopia, also on 
my sunglasses.
People from Milan were agreeing with the British population with the extent of making me 
move to Milan, become part of their software engineers community and avoid paying for what 
they have been stealing. They are still reading.
As part of this, to be considered is - people from Northern Italy have got the chance to improve 
their English skills communicating to the accused person and mimicking his declination of the 
language which includes many cultures. Bari, London and other variations given by colleagues and 
friends met during my journey of life. Irish and Australian expressions have been learnt without 
any consent given, by the accused or mentioned populations. 
From the perspective of the accused person, this behaviour (Rome Big Thief) was suffered again 
during his MSc Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome. 
Riccardo Cervelli, Michele Cernigliaro and others were part of it. They have exploited the 
knowledge I acquired at Aldo Moro - University of Bari during my BSc in Computer Science asking 
for help during the take home assessments development. Then they suddenly broke up with me.
It took years for me to learn by experience and It takes financial effort. For rent only, I spent more than 40000£.

2. It seems they are accusing of mental illness. This is not possible because of my healthy life style 
which includes regular study, practicing and training sessions. Even more, I am not part of 
those who still think mental illnesses even exit. Rome conspires you, Berlin sends you tablets. To the kiss.

3. I am suspicious of the planned destruction and reconstruction of the Italian state... It was  
probably arranged by Northern Italians. 
The plan is to move resources to Northern Italy first, then sell the South of Italy to East 
Europe. And make me guilty for most of the crimes that are part of this process. 
Le Iene TV show has probably recorded about the humanoid heroes' gestures. They were trying to 
put Northern Italy in a dominant position for the next war which is expected to be fought in the 
next few decades. 
They have been carry out deceiving agreements with Bari's allies. Namely, UK and US military 
forces.

4. A suspect of an MiG fighter jet landing in Gioia del Colle, Bari, South during this penal 
process (September / October 2024) was witnessed by the accused person. 
This time, cameras on my sunglasses could be helpful. It was really close to me and It was not pleasant for an American from Bari who I am.

5. Using cameras on glasses, they have experienced the development of a software 
architecture based on mathematical principles and inspired by QED.
It is called Five Magics, to pun after Einstein’s dissertation, dated 1906. 
This was developed using the currently in use MacBook Pro 2021 SN:FKPX7L9D36.
This was built with the extent of improving the military capabilities of the Americans in the South.
This is my Atlassian website I used https://calabrese-giuseppe.atlassian.net/ 
To build something similar to https://www.saab.com/products/Mission-Support-System

6. Using cameras on glass lenses (also sunglasses), they have committed privacy violations 
against myself and my family members. This includes a total of other 4 people, plus me. 

7. Scientific knowledge and learning path were stolen using the same methodology.

8. Currently, my criminal record is clean. Given my current location, Bari, there is no reason 
to share about me. Hardly, they could have rights to access in the UK only. 
I have an Italian passport from Bari. Its number is YB3363200. There is a preliminary
investigation judge (RG GIP 2045/22, RGNR 710/22, Proc. Pen. 12149/20 RGNR Mod 21, N. 895/24 RGNR Mod 21) and these two procedures have the same reasons behind. 
Rome and the Albanian mafia were behind all of it.

[What is below, was sent the day after]

[And this is what happened, as a consequence it seems](../Medical/CouncilOrderN41.jpeg)

They gave me an antipsychotic and I don’t need it. 

Please help

## Part 2

On the 26th of November 2024, at about 10AM Giuseppe Calabrese of Gioia del Colle, Bari (thereon `the accused person`) arrives at DSM, centre for mental health in Santeramo in Colle, Bari. Present were two collaborators (referring to themselves as nurses) of the psychiatrist.
The collaborator who was asked to provide evidence or references for the reason why the accused person is meant to undergo a mental health check stated, the reason mentioned on paper - family notice - is not the real reason.
Reasons behind the notification of mental check are related to people in Santeramo in Colle, Bari and to the military airport in Gioia del Colle, Bari. 
In particular, people from the bar of the library "Biblioteca Giovanni Colonna" located at Giuseppe DiVagno Sq. (Piazza Giovanni DiVagno), Santeramo in Colle, Bari after someone spitting on the table.
Collaborators asked the accused person to retry on the day after. 
It is suspected, the final aim was to make Martino Calabrese (father), or any other family member, sign a notification to Carabinieri or to the mental health centre itself. The extent is suspected to be avoiding people from Santeramo be investigated after beign part of mafia associations. 
The majority of people belonging to Santeramo in Colle community are part of the so called Albanian mafia.

On the 27th of November 2024, at about 11AM the accused person reaches the DSM again to obtain further explainations from the psychiatrist.
After scheduling an appointment for the 4th of December 2024 at 0930 and having a quick conversation with a different nurse, the psychiatrist does not 
seem to be happy to consider his future patient's concerns. This is, the accused person. The psychiatrist's from Gioia del Colle, Bari opinion is to inject a lower dose of the same antipsycothic. It was noticed by the accused person, the given dose amount was too high giving side-effects causing tiredness for the next 3 days after the injection.
It was also mentioned during the conversation, my penal solicitor mentioned given drug had not to be injected at all and a medical statement of good physical and mental health was presented to the medic, dated 26th of November 2024.
[Statement](../Medical/Certificates/GoodMentalPhysicalHealthCertificate2.pdf)
A particular worth mentioning is, the nurse were asked to schedule an appointment to conversate with more time and ease about the matter with the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist is confident instead about injecting a second dose of the same drug.

## Part 3

On the 4th of December - after scheduling an appointment to better understand the concerns - the accused person (Giuseppe Calabrese) meets at 0930 AM the psychiatrist (Anelli Francesco from Gioia del Colle).
After briefly explaining to him and the surrounding nurses the accused person was there to understand more about the cause for this treatment instead of being there for a second injection.
The accused person was invited in the personal room of the psychiatrist. Also, one of the nurses joined.
During this conversation, it was explained by the accused person, there are nuisances from the medical perspective and the perspective of the legal proceeding, that is international.

From the medical perspective, it was noticed the personal medic of the accused person had already established, there was no reason to undergo a medical treatment, that was instead prescribed by the psychiatrist. 
The drug prescribed is, Haldol Decanoas, 75ml per month. He is willing to inject a new medication on the 18th of December, 2024.

From the legal perspective, the Order attached in the Resource folder with ref. no. "41 of 20.11.2024" mentions people in the same household pointing out uncommon behaviours and indication of persecution mania of the accused person.
Point is, after investigation, the only person in the household that was asked about the accused person is under treatment himself since years ago. Not the right person to ask for indications, for sure. 
This is Martino Calabrese, father of the accused person. 
He stated, a few general questions were asked about the accused person by the psychiatrist.

People from the library in Santeramo in Colle, Bari have also stated they had no problem with the accused person.

At the office of the Council (comune di Santeramo in Colle), the Local Police was met to gather more information.
The opinion of the officer is, the accused person should undergo the treatment and it would not be a problem, since it would be easy in the future to reduce the dosage after a chat with the psychiatrist. 
The treatment in his opinion is just 'for helping the accused person go through this health problem'.

Note, all of what is written, unless otherwise stated, about this medical proceeding (that is verification and/or treatment) happens in Santeramo in Colle, Bari.
