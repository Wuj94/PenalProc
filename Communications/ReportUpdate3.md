On the 4th of December - after scheduling an appointment to better understand the concerns - the accused person (Giuseppe Calabrese) meets at 0930 AM the psychiatrist (Anelli Francesco from Gioia del Colle).
After briefly explaining to him and the surrounding nurses the accused person was there to understand more about the cause for this treatment instead of being there for a second injection, the accused person was invited in the personal room of the psychiatrist. Also one of the nurses joined the conversation.
During this conversation, it was explained by the accused person, there are nuisances from the medical perspective and the perspective of the legal proceeding, which is international.

From the medical perspective, it was noticed the personal medic of the accused person had already established, there was no reason to undergo a medical treatment, that was instead prescribed by the psychiatrist. The drug prescribed is, Haldol Decanoas, 75ml per month. He is willing to inject a new medication on the 18th of December, 2024.

From the legal perspective, the Order attached in the Resource folder with ref. no. "41 of 20.11.2024" mentions people in the same household pointing out uncommon behaviours and indication of persecution of the accused person.
Point is, after investigation, the only person in the household that was asked about the accused person is under treatment himself since years ago. Not the right person to ask for indications, for sure. This is Martino Calabrese, father of the accused person. He stated, few general questions were asked about the accused person by the psychiatrist.

People from the library in Santeramo in Colle have also stated they had no problem with the accused person.

At the Council Bari, in Santeramo in Colle, the Local Police was met to obtain more information.
The opinion of the officer is, the accused person should undergo the treatment and it would not be a problem, since it would be easy in the future to reduce the dosage after a chat with the psychiatrist. The treatment in his opinion is just 'for helping the accused person go through this health problem'.

Note, all of what is written about this medical verification / treatment happens in Santeramo in Colle, Bari.
