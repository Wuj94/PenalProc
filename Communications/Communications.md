# Communications

1. I am using Apple's mobile phone and laptop. These were not sold in Italy. The Italian government has no right to violate privacy. Of these two devices, provenance is known for my laptop. It is an English MacBook Pro.
Apple was more than once warned about privacy violation risks after the penal process was triggered. 
I am currently defining my own UK-based company using cutting edge technologies I have never worked with before.
The company is called `Calabrese Giuseppe Limited` and it is registered at HMRC (His Majesty Revenue and Custom), in the United Kingdom. As a reference, the Application Name is, CalabreseCompanyHmrc.
The purpose of the registration is the one given before and had been notified to the British Government before this communication happened.
2. Daily updates are made public at github.com/Wuj94/PenalProc. 
You can browse the update history at https://github.com/Wuj94/PenalProc/commits/main.
3. I am suspicitious about brain electrodes implanted into my skull. This might have happened after head traumas resulting from accidents happened when I was 4 or 5 and in 2018. 
It is easy to make misuse of these devices, by reusing the same principle the opposite way, it is possible to give OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder), for example.

4. Blood payment is clearly accepted, if compatible with the law (of Bari and the international law - no one gives a fuck about Rome and Milan). 
It was clearly said, the accused person is from the Southern part of the country, or Palermo instead of Milan. A way, to geographically identify the provenance of the accused person. 
No explicit reference to the population belonging to Palermo is meant to be given. North Africa is the law.

Notice, the process is called - `No mercy - Laugh in front of this`.
