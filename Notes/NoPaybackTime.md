# Things to give back to the South (Bari, Palermo, Potenza)

## Human Rights to be kept

## International Rights

1. Right to buy in the UK and in the US.

## Penal Process

1. It is heavily skewed by the religious perspective
2. Genetics. They are less developed or advanced genetically. This makes it impossible for them to explain or understand people from the South who are more developed. Genetic tests are proving it. A less complex organism cannot manage a more complex one. Try the problem of managing a mechanism with 2 handles with another mechanism. How many handles will the mechanism have? More than 2. Otherwise, to reduce the number of handles, you can build a shaft which still has two connecting bars and reduces the flexibility in functionality of the  managed mechanism. Try . . . (even for 3, 4 or how many handles you want) 
 
## Immediate Removal of devices from people's ears

1. The new device used by NATO and Rome allows them to torture people. This is the way they are going to keep control on a more advanced population. The one from the South.
2. This device is not successful. It gives people distress, anger and gives  feelings to start acting violent.

## Immediate Removal of cameras and other recording devices managed by Rome 

1. Similar to in-ear devices managed by Rome, these recording devices spread on people's habitations are meant to keep control over the more complex population of Bari from Rome. This is not compliant with the internation and European laws or regulations about privacy.

## Immediate Removal of Unauthorized Settlement of Albanian, Romanian (Rom, Romanian or Ru-manian [Russian criminals mostly]) populations

1. The deceiving understanding of people referring to the Albanian mafia belonging to Bari does not hold anymore. These people are often disturbing and scaring the local population (Bari's) with the aim of reconstructing the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (aka, 4th Reich)
[More info - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Reich).

## Greece and Kossovo
These territory are Bari's territories, obtained during the WWII. Nowadays, Rome is unlawfully using peaceful maps to gain control over these populations.

## Never see people explaining other people by engineering practices/concepts/whatever

1. Science explains nature. Science can be used to explain/understand people. Fuck the uber genius engineers.

## Energy - real assets

1. Potenza region
2. Wind turbine in Santeramo in Colle produce energy to be used in Northern Italy. Is it regulated? *H*o*w*?! 

## Communications

1. 5G antennas are really dangerous - Due to their working frequencies, those waves are capable of exerting pressure strong enough to move toxic micro organisms into the air. In Santeramo in Colle (BA), the 5G antenna was stolen by the Albanian mafia (Rome). This point is really high in the province of Bari and the antenna can be used to infect the population in Bari, at need.
2. The dipole system - It is to given back to Gioia del Colle airport. It is needed by the population and it has no use in the Northern part of the country. To find out why, read about the dipole.
3. The telephone network - It is suspected that Northern Italians have gained access to networking and telephone infrastructure that are not meant to be used by them, after war agreements.
