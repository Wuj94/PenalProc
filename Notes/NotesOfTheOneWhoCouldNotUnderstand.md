## Turns
1. Fourth Reich or the Holy Roman-German Empire - (London)+, Berlin, Rome, Altamura/Santeramo (driven by Rome), Tirana, Bucharest, Moscow (they probably had to withdraw at some point during the process)
	1.1 Rome, Madrid, Lisbon, South Aliens  
2. The Western Roman Empire - Rome, Madrid, Lisbon, South Aliens flowing into the US through Mexico 

## Caughts

### At University
1. So, it was me at di.uniba sharing the f-ing IntelliJ when all of the others were using Eclipse.
2. What was the monster-lardon doing (aka monster-fat who could become monster-jelly if he well-behaves) at di.uniba?
3. ... 

### At Work


## Science-based Statement
1. Dipole - different interpretations - the dipole from Rome cannot exist. Even less from Milan. It comes from immigration flows, cultural differences at the two ends, ... 
2. Nature is harmonic. There are cyclic phenomena.  Nature is explained by science. Many mathematical concepts can be plotted as sinusoids.
	For example, the L2-metric space is harmonic and it can be easily used to . . . It also applies for the concept of Normality desribed by the Gaussian.
	There are cyclic natural phenomena related to society. Listen to the songs . . . Did it happen before? The Aliens are coming, aren't they?
	They actually are already there, Americans.WoW.
	There are also unnatural cyclic phenomena. Like those sparked by the Nazis. They fake it to be natural. 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3dvbM6Pias ... The Arian cycle - every 25 years they invade. 1944 - 1974 - 1999 - 2024. What's wrong with the Nazis?
3. In Europe, the North depends on the South. The North contributes to the South from the scientific and military perspective. The South provides work force. 
4. Relative prime numbers to make desicions using consensus avoiding ties. 
5. The reason why, the west side of the world have been struggling dealing with Russian populations comes after a different effect of traumas over people from this cold region. Extremely cold weather conditions make Russian people feel traumas much less. For what humans are used to do during their lives, in the best case they give other humans the same treatment they give to themselves. Russian people don't feel traumas in most of the cases. As a consequence, they might be seen as rude since they treat people from the West side of the world as if they couldn't feel traumas as well. The reason behind this comes from chemical reaction in our brain that do not happen or are weaker under cold weather conditions.
6. From that branch of graph theory that is related to sociology and the 6 degrees of separation, you should never trust close people who are advertising themselves not to share knowledge. For instance, If there is someone from Rome (or any other city) that says, "they are separated, we have no agreement with them", referring to another group of people acting in a different way, well . . . just stay away. Please remember, by the law, knowledge is shared thoroughlyinside a region of a (military) map. For example, in Northern Italy in the community of Northern Italians. (Milan is Rome)
7. In 2018, at CS dept in Bari, I found out, you can run the JVM on Linux. 

## Nazi-related 
1. The Nazi tricks inverting the dependencies.
	1.1 Pure is superior. Damn false.
	1.2 People from the city centre, usually on a valley or near the sea are always superior. False.
	1.3 ...
2. Induced wars - People from the city centre are told to be and act as superiors against people from nearby hills. This is not true and it is needed to 
	build a war-context. People from the hills, experiencing different atmospheric conditions many times are more evoluted. They have a better idea of 
	people coming from the city centre. They do not want to surrender since they might actually be genitically superior. But, people from the city 
	centre are more numerous. So, they are told to act superior and trained by the Nazis to fight against people from the countryside. 
	This situation leads to generation of energy due to arguments between these two parties. Here, in this setting, people from the city centre manage
	to gain or extract some knowledge due to the energy increase (people arguing and coming up against). 
	Hence, the overall interaction from the start is beneficial for the city centre. People from the country side are right and  defeated 
	and they feel anger after it. The very end of this interaction is a violent crime.
3. Destroy the South and the North using a divide-and-conquer approach. After dividing, the conquer pass is carried out iteratively.
4. Nazism is based on a social system. Every system needs fuel. The State is fed by taxes, the engine of a car is fed by petrol. The Nazi system ? It could be fed by taxes but, if the State system is still running you need a different fuel. This is resources. Some people's resources. As the Nazi system acquires resources, the population who is (forcefully) giving resources will starve. Extermination is the final result.
	4.1 Rights
	4.2 Knowledge
	4.3 . . .   
5. Rome is part of Northern Italy - As part of `Rome big thief`, people from Rome change their side of the country to exploit resources that do not belong to them, using the so called peaceful maps. These maps are not relevant outside the Italian peninsula.

### Biology related
1. Phenotype won't move.
2. Extermination of the dominant population.
3. The biological problem of Rome & any other culturally dominant population - the Romans are loosers but they act like winners. They never surrender and constantly try to impose themselves but, their pheno/bio/geno-type does not allow them to make right decisions for other dominant populations.
4. The lupins, light and gas allowances - There is somebody else buying lupins from Spain already. Light and gas would come from Russia, what about lupins after selling the Southern part of the country? We eat the Cloud.
5. Big teeth do not mean strength, it means inevolution.
6. The Human Stack - Walking into the nearby dpt of Biology at Uniba my brain sparked a thought. A human can be understood by its origin. At least, this is something we surely consider during a penal process. More than its origin and its location we can easily explain in few words what makes up a human. The stack is (in reverse order):
	6.1. Genotype - This is about genetics. Your genes clearly depend on the origin of your ancestors. Using a genetic test, you can easily compare humans and describe their strenghts, or give expectations to them.
	6.3. Biotype - This time, we consider the biological enviornemnt that surrounds a human being. You consider, the weather, fauna, flora, and the atmosphere. Currently, we have satellites orbiting around the Earth which can help understand many phenomenae that influence the biotype of a human.
	6.2 Phenotype - Depending on genetics, you consider observable characteristics of a human. The easiest way to compare two phenotypes is, to consider past wars. In particular, if two population were at war in the past, then the one that won is the dominant population. A more polite way to explain could be related to the language. Considering different dialects in Italy, for example, we might infer that the population able to read and/or write the biggest number of dialects is the one with a more powerful phenotype. Similarly, you can compare the ease-of-learning of different languages to understand this characteristic of a human.
	6.4 Culture - We all know what it is but it should be clear that this is a bias. As such, stay away from all of those who show off their ability to change their behaviour in their daily life, since culture implies strong habits. It won't take long for these people to go back to their behaviors. It is worth mentioning, mafia, fascism or nazism is an overload over culture. Since, culture is actually modelled by the laws.
	6.5 ... - An then it is all about how you suck. And how your ((great)* grand)* parents thought you to.
 
### Linguistic related
1. You can list Italian dialects by difficulty. You can also do it for the English declinations. Clearly, the American dialect is easier to learn for Southern Italians than the British one. The same way, the British declination of the language is easier to learn for Southern Italian than it is for Northern Italian. Because of the influence given in the past. Think about expressions . . . they are really similar.

### War
1. Gestalt's laws - Break any to make a war happen at any time
	1.1 break the proximity principle to start up a war 
	1.2 ...
2. Trade deals
	2.1 Russian gas
	2.2 Italian language 
3. The deceiving London-Rome agreement
	3.1 ...
4. The Italian language (which mostly derives from Bari since its Greek root) has been shared with the Russian population, by means of television programme.
5. The Trani's (Bari) fantry won the WWII along with US and UK. In Gioia del Colle, they were all from Bari when they helped the RAF/USAF going through. They were *not* f- Austrians or Albanians who are trying to take control. They were on the opposite side.

### Economy 
1. The pattern of the chinese population approaching the South in the early 00s has been spotted again with the Russian population coming. It was all managed by Rome & Milan. 

## Rome & Rome Albanian mafia's procedures 
1. The aftermath - run around the victim to undestand if he realised it was you committing the crime 
2. The all but one - for an excluded person or someone to traumatise who proposed a change, the entire group of people must agrees on something but one. 
	The rule is, the change happens only if all of the people from the group agree.
3. Change or add one letter of the name of the mafia family after a movement (it basically works for any Ru-mafia) 
4. Change the peaceful maps and say, it's Bari's fault 

# Rights
1. International right transfer from Bari to Northern Italy. Never approved. Those rights in Gioia del Colle area are my fucking rights. 

# More
1. During a chat with Roberto from Santeramo who is a school teacher, I proposed as a solution to the current problem given by big hierarchy of people, known as social systems making the Italian army united across the entire country and at the same time making each region independent, following the US configuration. Somebody said, they made it for the first part, not for the second. It makes things worse because people with a wrong culture now have no reason to improve. They feel safe when they talk shit.  
2. Once, it’s a coincidence, Twice is happenstance. Nine times, it’s definitely a Bryde’s whale. - Ann Allen, about biotwangs
3. A vngiut saienz. Sit capsciut? Meh
4. Claudio Mastronardo, born the 21st of July (at least what he says) who lives in Station Rd (Via Stazione), Santeramo in Colle, Bari, 70029 is my tailored persecutor and conspirator. He started persecuting me when I was less than 10 years old. He promised many times to stop, and he has never done it.
