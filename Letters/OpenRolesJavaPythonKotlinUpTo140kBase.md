Hi Lee,

Thank you for reaching out to me.

I am currently looking for new opportunities in London.  Ideally, contracting inside IR35 on Scala as a functional software engineer.
Needless to say, I would still consider opportunities for matching companies on the JVM (Scala and Java preferred).
Feel free to share any of the available opportunities. I will surely come back with an opinion, and we can proceed after it.

My CV is attached at the end for your reference.

Have a great rest of your day.

Kind regards,
Giuseppe

Thanks for your reply Giuseppe!
 
Will you consider perm roles too? I have no contracts currently.
 
Did your last role finish 18 months ago? What’s the reason for the break?
 
Cheers,
Lee

Yes, I could.

Nice question, Lee. Agreed then.
I will try not to get too heavy on the subject.

I understand the debts of Italy and the UK after Covid-19 + No more gas from Russia + Brexit, but the nazi Europe won’t be the solution that will fit my profile.
Conspiracy from Italy propagated up to London (The North, you get me? Hopefully we are on the same map :) ). 
The South was forgotten and now the Russians are at the door. The door is the South, but they are looking for the North as well. 
It will not be me deciding to let them in or not, though.

What about my specific case? It’ s a train of consequence, I’m not part on any criminal organization (mafia or fascism or nazism are all illegal in the South). The only one which is accepted by default by the Italian state (since 1946 at least) in the South is mafia. In the North is fascism. 
They were mixing these two, and I was unattached. Then, I became hard to manage. What was the glue? The Albanian Mafia. Which is NOT mafia from Bari.
Hence, the discussion should be over just here. Because the Italian state by default accept Italian mafia associations *only*.

But, the law is equal for everyone and you can’t change the context during a penal process. 
And, at the moment, there is a penal process where I am the only accused person. 

It takes some time to realise that internationally (I am UK resident), it doesn't work traumatising people who are not part of (illigal) `social systems` and ask them to pay for natural reactions. If you are not part of any social system, you feel the energy of the trauma flowing through your spine. 
Otherwise, you share with your partners in crime. And it feels much less.

What’s the final truth? In Bari, just a few are not attached and do not work for the army or the state or government in general.
Similarly, In Milan the same happens and I don’t care much to be fair. I’m from Bari and I moved to London. 
There was a detour in Rome and we couldn’t match. 

Northern Italy is not for me. 
It’s been hard to adapt to the mafia social system as an outsider since I was a child. At this stage, I’m not ready to start with the nazi-fascist social system. They do not make much sense to me. I like science.

Maybe, for some people looked like a clear opportunity to get someone to work in Northern Italy, submit to the fascists, pay taxes to Rome and let people from the South enjoy the tender for the construction of a new public infrastructure. 

Does It sound like a clever guess?
Trust me, stop the Albanian Mafia. We are just making it worse. (The brain-bypass left-to-right-ear still works as a technique). 
Then, the extent Nazi-mafia-fascist (we have really strange beasts at the moment) could be useful to modern society is still a point I need to explain to myself.

Kind regards,
Giuseppe

P.s.
Any position in available in the US? :) 
Nonno was American, grand nonno became American, daddy is from England (Gioia), mommy is from Powerland ooooohmmm (I’m summoning it).
Thanks!
